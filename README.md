snap-datasets
=============

A collection of network datasets for testing the [snap-examples](https://github.com/jsw883/snap-examples)
repository (and for any other network software that you have lying around,
naturally). These datasets were obtained from various online sources, and
these will be updated and posted here shortly.

### Installation ###

Download the snap-datasets repository into a snap-datasets directory under
the snap root directory, and start using the makefiles in the snap-examples
repository to either get errors or get things working.
